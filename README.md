The code quiz web API is a functioning quiz on the fundamentals of JavaScript. When you click the start button, the timer starts and you are presented with a question. When you answer the question, you are presented with a new question. If you answer the question wrong, time will be deducted from the timer. The quiz ends when you have answered all of the questions or the timer reaches zero. When that happens, you will be prompted to put in you initials and your score will be saved, along with others who have taken the quiz, so you can see your high scores.
